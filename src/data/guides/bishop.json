No effect against the abilities of Tech Champions.\nAbsorb the kinetic energy of a well-timed Block to generate 5% Power plus 3 stacks of Prowess. Prowess gained in this way is doubled against Skill Champions and tripled against Energy-based Special Attacks. No effect against the attacks of Tech Champions.\n\nBlocking\n\nSteadily consume Prowess to Regenerate 97 Health per Prowess consumed.\nEach Prowess consumed has a 100% chance to Purify 1 Bleed Debuff(s).\nConsumption starts after a brief delay of holding block, and steadily pulls off 1 Prowess at a time to Regenerate and, if applicable, remove 1 Bleed Debuff.\n\nSpecial Attacks\n\nConsume all Prowess and gain +10% Special Damage per stack consumed.\n\nWarning: Power Overload!\n\n81 Health per second is lost for each Prowess above a stack of 30.\nIf Bishop stays at full Power for more than 9 seconds, he begins to overload and lose 97 Health per second until that Power is spent. The longer he stays at full Power, the more Health is lost.\nActivate any Special Attack to expel stored energy and avoid unnecessary damage!",
        "note": "If you exit a fight with two bars, you’ll start the next fight with two bars; however, don’t hoard your Power for too long, as Bishop will start losing Health if he waits too long before spending Power. More information on how Bishop overloads can be found below."
