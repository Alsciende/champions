    "description": "One of the greatest warriors of Asgard, Heimdall was appointed Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge for all time, by Odin All-Father. His eyes can see all of creation, and his ears can hear a whisper from anywhere in the Nine Realms. Heimdall has many times saved Asgard, detecting threats long before they can become a danger, and either dispatching the threat himself or sounding Gjallarhorn to call forth the other defenders of Asgard."
