            "note": "After spending a few fights building Power Cosmic, Air-Walker is able to unleash the Power of Galactus. This buff has a laundry list of effects, but one to pay particular attention to is the Power Gain. It’s equal to the amount of Power he would gain from 3 Power Cosmic Buffs, so the Power Galactus won’t cause him to lose out on all the Power gain he gets from charging his Heavy Attack."
