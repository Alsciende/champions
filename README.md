## Mobile Structure

   Quickguide on how to use the site created by this .git
  
### Roster Manager

#### Roster Page

    This is the default view where you can view and modify your roster.
    
    Use the side panel to open an Add Champion subpage as well as filter and sort your champions.
    
    Selecting a champion here lets you update their rank, level and other attributes.

    
#### Team Page

    This is where your teams will be displayed (with extras if the option is selected) once they are built.

    From the build settings panel you can go to the advanced settings page or build a set of teams.
    
#### Guide Page

    These pages give details on each champion: abilities, styles, synergies and availablity.
    
### Synergy Tool

    This tool lets you see the synergies between all champions of a given star value.
    
    Double-clicking on a desktop browser will redirect to the Roster Manager's Guide for that champion.
